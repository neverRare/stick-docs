# Statement vs Expression

Statement and expression are mutually exclusive, a definition can be a statement, an expression, or both, but not neither. Statement means it can stand alone as a whole single statement, and expression simply means it evaluates to a value.

For example, prefix operation is an expression but not a statement. Solely using it as a statement results in syntax error, and needed to be wrapped in curve bracket `()` in order to be syntactically valid (although, it may yield a warning in linting).

## Declaration

Declarations are statements that requires an identifier.
