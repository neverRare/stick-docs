# Comment

Comment is used to add few note for stick codes, they are ignored by the compiler.

```stick
-- this is a single line comment

---
this is a multiline comment
---
```

In multiline comments, the starting triple dash `---` must be preceded by an indentation (or a line break) and it will match the next `---` with the same indentation.

## Documenting

Stick doesn't have dedicated syntax for documenting comments, regular comments can be used for documenting.
