# ![Stick Icon](./stick_small_icon.webp) Stick Docs

An informal specification and reference of Stick programming language.

Currently, as incomplete as this doc is, there's no complete compiler (I'm working on it). If you're interested, I'd recommend reading [features.md](./features.md) which gives you brief look of what Stick would look like. I gotta say, its pretty ambitious and experimental (and maybe crazy).
