# ![Stick Icon](./stick_small_icon.webp) Stick Docs

An informal specification and reference of Stick programming language. Stick is still under development, and here's my goal for Stick.

- Allow python-like style or brace style, even mix of it.
- Make it capable for non-english language.
- The compiler should infer rich types while keeping the language simple and concise.
- It should be applicable for many kinds of project.
